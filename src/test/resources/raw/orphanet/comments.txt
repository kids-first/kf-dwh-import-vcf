Description of the XML tags

- DisorderList count: total number of clinical entities (disorders, group of disorders or
subtypes) in the Xml file
- ORPHAcode – a unique and time-stable numerical identifier attributed randomly by the
database upon creation of the entity. Currently, the ORPHACode is made up of one to six
digits. In the future, number of digits can expand. It comes with:
o ExpertLink: stable URL pointing to the specific page of a given disease on the Orphanet
website.
o Name: the most generally accepted name according to the literature, and as adopted by
the medical community. Preferred terms are unique throughout the database,
associated with one ORPHAcode only.
o Lang: ISO 639 code or UTF8 code for language name.
- SynonymList: synonymsfor a given clinical entity (Terms that are perfectly equivalent to the
preferred term they are attached to. As many synonyms as necessary are added to a
preferred term. Acronyms are included only when they are consistently used in the
literature).
- Definition: short text stating the group of disorders that the clinical entity belongs to, and
listing the major clinical characteristics (e.g. clinical, pathological, radiological, etc.) that
define the entity and differentiate it from other entities classified within the same clinical
group.
- DisorderGroup: Hierarchical levels of the clinical entity that determine the level of
precision of each diagnosis included in the nomenclature. Can be either Group of
disorders, Disorder or Subtype of disorder (see definitions in annex)
- DisorderType: can be either Disease, Clinical syndrome, Malformation syndrome,
Biological anomaly, Morphological anomaly, Category, Clinical group, Etiologicalsubtype,
Clinical subtype, Histopathological subtype or Particular clinical situation in a disease or
syndrome (see definitions in annex)
- DisorderFlag: Most of clinical entities do not have a flag but for the other can be either
head of classification, historical entity, deprecated entity, obsolete entity, obsolete entity
with resources or non-rare disease in Europe (see definitions in annex)
- ExternalReferenceList: list of cross-references for a given clinical entity in the ICD-10,
UMLS, MesH, MedDra, and OMIM systems
- Source: can be either OMIM, UMLS, MesH, MedDra or ICD-10
- Reference: listed reference for a given source associated with a clinical entity
- DisorderMappingRelation: characterisation of the alignment between a given clinical
entity and one of the source. Can be either E, NTBT, BTNT, NTBT/E, BTNT/E, ND (see
explanations in annex)
- DisorderMappingICDRelation: additional characterization used only for ICD-10. Can be
either Specific code, Inclusion term, Index term or Attributed (see explanations in annex)
- DisorderMappingValidationStatus: Status validation between the given clinical entity and the
ttreference. Can be either Validated or Not yet validated
- DisorderDisorderAssociation: Relationship between two clinical entities – Please note that
in this file the relationship “Moved to” and “Referred to” are displayed and that the
hierarchical relationships are given in the Orphanet classifications file.
